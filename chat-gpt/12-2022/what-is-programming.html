Imagine that you have a special machine that can do anything you tell it to do. This machine is called a computer. To make the computer do what you want, you have to give it a set of instructions, and these instructions are called a program.</p><p>Programming is like giving the computer a set of step-by-step instructions to follow to do something. For example, you might tell the computer to open a website, or to play a game, or to do some math.</p><p>To give the computer these instructions, we use a special language that the computer can understand. This language is called a programming language. There are many different programming languages, and each one is a little bit different, but they all work in the same way.</p><p>When you write a program, you have to be very careful to make sure that your instructions are clear and that you don't make any mistakes. This is because the computer is very good at following instructions, but it can't understand what you mean if you don't tell it exactly what to do.</p><p>Once you've written your program, you can run it on the computer and it will do exactly what you told it to do. This is called "executing" the program.</p><p>So, in a nutshell, programming is like giving the computer a set of instructions to follow in order to do something. It can be a lot of fun, and it can be very useful, too.</p></div></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2"></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full h-48 flex-shrink-0"></div></div></div></body></html>
